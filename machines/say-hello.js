       * The `example` indicates the expected return value from the exit.
       *
       * It works pretty much like the `example` for inputs, and follows the same rules.
       *
       * If the actual value passed to this exit callback from your machine `fn` doesn't match the type inferred
       * from `example`, the value will be converted to match the example before being passed to the user's callback.
       * In general, missing data will be converted to the "falsy" value for its type.
       *
       * So:
       * • missing strings will be filled-in as `''`' (empty string)
       * • missing numbers will be filled-in as `0`
       * • missing booleans will be filled-in as `false`
       *
       *
       * In the `example` below, if `fn` called:
       * ```
       * exits.success(['something completely wrong']);
       * ```
       *
       * Then the user's callback would receive:
       * ```
       * {
       *   numLettersInName: 0,
       *   secretCode: '',
       * }
